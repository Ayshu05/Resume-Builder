# Resume-Builder
Created a CV Builder application that provides a template regarding what information to include in a CV (Ex: Picture, Bio-data, Skills, Qualification, Work Experience). 
It collects the information in a form, presents it in a structured template in a document by placing fields in appropriate positions in the page. 
Also, generates the document as a pdf and lends it to the user for their utility. In addition, the application stores
previously entered information (in a database) and retrieves it when searched for making changes to existing CV.
